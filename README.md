## What is Selects
A collection of checkbox animations made in CSS / Sass using the "Checkbox Hack". There is no Javascript used. The checkboxes use the <label> element for their inputs and hide checkbox inputs due to their limited CSS support. By using a for attribute on the <label> element, you tell the browser which label belongs which input.

<label for="myName">Label</label> 
<input name="myName" />
Animations are created using the keyframe animations. Some also include the :before and :after pseudo elements of labels. These can be used in real world projects.
